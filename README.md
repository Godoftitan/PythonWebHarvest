# PythongWebHarvest
A Python-based web data scraping suite for harvesting Chinese novels (with full chapter support) and beyond. Features built-in anti-scraping measures—dynamic User-Agent rotation, rate limiting, and retry logic—and a modular framework easily extendable to scrape anime sites, image galleries, APIs, and more.
